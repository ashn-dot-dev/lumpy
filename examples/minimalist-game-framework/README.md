# Minimalist Lumpy Game Framework

Game development framework in the style of Zach Barth's [Minimalist Game
Framework](https://github.com/zachbarth/minimalist-game-framework). The guts of
the framework can be found in the `mingf` directory, and an example game can be
found in `game.lumpy`.

To play the example game, run:

```sh
/path/to/lumpy$ ./lumpy examples/minimalist-game-framework/game.lumpy
```
